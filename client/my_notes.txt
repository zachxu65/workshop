Some techinical notes.
1. Syntax of "imports"
Below are some examples of "imports":
  import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
  import { CarService } from '../shared/car/car.service';
  
  In the first import, the "core" is a folder in the folder node_modules/@angular. This folder has many subfolders and files.
  There is one file 
      public_api.d.ts 
  This file has one line 
      export * from './src/core'; 
  Here src/core is a folder. In this folder, there is the file
      core.d.ts
  This file has multiple exports statements.  I think these statements specifies what artifacts are exported.
  
  In the second import, "car.service" is not a folder. It must imply the file car.service.ts. And this file has statements
  that specify what are exported. 
  
  So the above shows two ways of how to use "import".
