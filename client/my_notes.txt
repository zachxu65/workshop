Some techinical notes.
1. Syntax of "imports"
Below are some examples of "imports":
  import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
  import { CarService } from '../shared/car/car.service';
  
  In the first import, the "core" is a folder in the folder node_modules/@angular. This folder has many subfolders and files.
  There is one file 
      public_api.d.ts 
  This file has one line 
      export * from './src/core'; 
  Here src/core is a folder. In this folder, there is the file
      core.d.ts
  This file has multiple exports statements.  I think these statements specifies what artifacts are exported.
  
  In the second import, "car.service" is not a folder. It must imply the file car.service.ts. And this file has statements
  that specify what are exported. 
  
  So the above shows two ways of how to use "import".
  
  2. Some modifications on the original files
  Some files copied from the original files does not compile. Also some modules in node_modules give compilation error. I modified them. 
  The error in the application is because it uses different version of modules in node_modules. I modified the code a little bit so it compiles with the modules in node_modules. The error in a module in node_module is caused by the comment line in the .json file. The comment line may not be allowed in json files. So I just deleted these comment lines.
