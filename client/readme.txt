This project and the the project server are both from the online example at
https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/12/04/basic-crud-angular-and-spring-boot.

The example is to integrate Spring boot 2 and Angular 5. 

The server is written using Spring boot and runs on localhost:8080.

The client is written using Angular 5 and runs on localhost:4200.

The client calls a service that gets data from localhost:8080. So there is a cross-origin issue. The server
implements the cross-origin to allow the action.  

To run the example,  do the following:
  1. Run DemoApplication.java as an application. This will make localhost:8080 work.
  2. On command line, run "ng serve" in the "client" folder.  This will make localhost:4200 work. 
  3. Open a browser and use the URL localhost:4200. The page will show a list of cars. 
  
 Notes:
 1. To actually run the example, nodejs, npm, etc need to be installed on the local laptop. 
 2. This "client" project in the Git repository does not include the folder node_modules which is huge and generated by 
    the Angular CLI tool.
