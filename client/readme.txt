This project and the the project server are both from the online example at
https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/12/04/basic-crud-angular-and-spring-boot.

The example is to integrate Spring boot 2 and Angular 5. 

The server is written using Spring boot and runs on localhost:8181.

The client is written using Angular 5 and runs on localhost:4200.

The client calls a service that gets data from localhost:8181. So there is a cross-origin issue. The server
implements the cross-origin to allow the action.  

To run the example,  do the following:
  1. Run DemoApplication.java as an application. This will make localhost:8181 work.
  2. On command line, run "ng serve" in the "client" folder.  This will make localhost:4200 work. 
  3. Open a browser and use the URL localhost:4200. The page will show a list of cars. 
  
 Notes:
 1. To actually run the example, nodejs, npm, etc need to be installed on the local laptop. 
 2. This "client" project in the Git repository does not include the folder node_modules which is huge and generated by 
    the Angular CLI tool.  
    
To deploy the client application to Tomcat, do the following:
 1. Go to the client folder. Execute the command "ng build --prod". This will generate the dist folder in client.
 2. Copy the folder client in dist to the Tomcat webapps folder.
 3. In the webapps/client folder, there is the file index.html. Modify the line 
       <base href="/">
    to 
       <base href="/client/">
 4. Run Run DemoApplication.java as an application. And start the Tomcat server.
 5. Open a browser and go to the URL  localhost:8080/client.  It should display the list of the cars.
 
 Notes:
 1. It seems that with the above deployment, the default port number 4200 was not relevant now.
 2. The above deployment uses two servers: Tomcat and the Spring boot embedded server. So there is the cross-origin
    issue here. If you want to use a different port number for Tomcat, do not forget to modify the port number 
    in the car.service.ts accordingly!
