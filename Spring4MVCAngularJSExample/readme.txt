This project is copied from http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-mvc-4-angularjs-example to learn about integration of Spring MVC 
and angularjs.

I made some files.  One change is to add a tomcat plugin into the pom.xml file so it can be deployed to the local tomcat server using maven. 

Usage:  
  In eclipse,  run the following
      mvn clean tomcat:deploy
Then go to http://localhost:8080/Spring4MVCAngularJSExample/.   It should show the web page.
